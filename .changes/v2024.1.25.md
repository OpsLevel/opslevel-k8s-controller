## [January 25, 2024]((https://github.com/OpsLevel/opslevel-k8s-controller/compare/v2024.1.13...v2024.1.25))
### Feature
* Add ability to pass a Context to the K8sController which will stop event processing
* Bump actions/cache from 3 to 4
* Bump k8s.io/apimachinery from 0.29.0 to 0.29.1
* Bump k8s.io/klog/v2 from 2.120.0 to 2.120.1
### Bugfix
* Prevent nil pointer dereference when reading K8sEvents
* The mainloop now supports a nil waitgroup so that the controller can be used continuously instead of for just one run
* Fix bug where events could sometimes be missed when starting K8sController to run once
